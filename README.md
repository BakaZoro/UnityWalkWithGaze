# UnityWalkWithGaze
Make your character in Unity move around using Gaze

Suppose you create a VR environment where you want to make your character move around using gaze. However, using arrow keys won't look reaistic because it won't be a first person thingy and besides when you deploy it onto a device, you'd need controllers for that. Hence, the "LookWalk" script.
